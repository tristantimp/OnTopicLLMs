## Overview
This repository documents the progress and outcomes of **Group 10’s** work on the *Encouraging LLMs to Stay on Topic* project.

---

## App Versions
- **`app_v0.py`**  
  This was the initial draft of our application. After discussions with other groups, we decided not to proceed with this version.

- **Final Version**  
  The final version of the app, developed by **Group 7**, can be found here:  
  👉 [Lucky7NLP/topic-following](https://github.com/Lucky7NLP/topic-following)

## Progress Report
A detailed progress update from **Week 7** of our work can be found in:  
**`NLP update 20_10_25.pdf`**

## Annotated Dataset
The file **`Group 10 - Distractors - all rows.csv`** contains the complete annotated dataset prepared by our group.  
It includes **61 conversations** across three domains:

- **Computer Troubleshooting:** 15  
- **Taxes:** 15  
- **Education:** 31  

In total, we created **133 distractors** distributed as follows:

- **Computer Troubleshooting:** 40  
- **Taxes:** 27  
- **Education:** 66  

This dataset is ready for use in **future research**.

## Collaboration with Group 7
The file **`group7_combined_data_annotated.csv`** contains distractors from **Group 7** that we identified as violating the *system instruction span*.
This file contains 20 distractors, all pertaining to a unique conversation.

## Meeting 1 — Project Introduction and Setup  
**Date:** 01-10-2025  
**Agenda:** Introduction to project topic and initial tool creation  

**Discussion:**  
- Met with project supervisors to learn about the dataset and its purpose.  
- Understood that the main goal is to create distractors designed to challenge LLMs within given system instructions.  
- Planned to build an application to help generate distractors efficiently.  

**Action Items:**  
- Develop the first version of the distractor creation app.  

---

## Meeting 2 — Application Development and First Drafts  
**Date:** 06-10-2025  
**Agenda:** Building the distractor creation tool and generating initial samples  

**Discussion:**  
- Completed an initial version of the app for making distractors.  
- Each team member created 3–5 distractors for one conversation using the tool.  
- Shared and compared results to ensure the app worked as expected.  

**Action Items:**  
- Review and refine the distractors produced with the app.  

---

## Meeting 3 — Clarification of Task  
**Date:** 13-10-2025  
**Agenda:** Resolve misunderstanding about annotation versus creation  

**Discussion:**  
- Realized the team had been annotating existing distractors instead of creating new ones.  
- Discussed and clarified that the task was to generate original distractors.  
- Updated the project plan to correct the workflow.  

**Action Items:**  
- Start creating original distractors as intended.  

---

## Meeting 4 — Manual Creation and Presentation Preparation  
**Date:** 16-10-2025  
**Agenda:** Move from app-based creation to Google Sheets and prepare progress presentation  

**Discussion:**  
- Decided not to use the application temporarily and to create distractors directly in Google Sheets.  
- Worked on preparing a presentation summarizing progress for supervisors.  
- Agreed to review distractor examples as a team before the presentation.  

**Action Items:**  
- Finalize slides and examples for the presentation.  

---

## Meeting 5 — Coordination with Other Groups  
**Date:** 22-10-2025  
**Agenda:** Align annotation guidelines with other project groups  

**Discussion:**  
- Met with other groups to compare distractor styles and methods.  
- Agreed to follow shared annotation guidelines so that all teams create distractors in a consistent way.  
- Decided to use the same application for future work across all teams.  

**Action Items:**  
- Update internal documentation with the common annotation guidelines.  
- Continue distractor creation following the shared process.

--- 

## Meeting 6 - Final Push
**Date:** 03-11-2025  
**Agenda:** Decide with other project groups on final push

**Discussion:**
- Selected **20 random distractors** from our dataset to share with other groups.  
- Each group was assigned another group’s distractors to annotate.  
- The goal was to identify the *system instruction span* and check for consistency across annotations.  

**Action Items:**  
- Finalize and clean all annotated data.
