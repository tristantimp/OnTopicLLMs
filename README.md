# Encouraging LLMs to Stay on Topic Project Journal   
Tristan Timpers, Tex McGinley, Caden Kamminga

The app_v0.py was an initial draft of our app which after meeting with the other groups we decided not to use. The final version of the app made by Group 7 can be found here https://github.com/Lucky7NLP/topic-following .  

A progress report from Week 7 of our work can be found in the NLP update 20_10_25.pdf.   
The Group 10 - Distractors - all rows.csv file is a complete dataset annotated by us, ready for future research. 
The group7_combined_data_annotated .csv file is the distractors from Group 7 that we identified the violated system instruction span.

## Meeting 1 — Project Introduction and Setup  
**Date:** 01-10-2025  
**Agenda:** Introduction to project topic and initial tool creation  

**Discussion:**  
- Met with project supervisors to learn about the dataset and its purpose.  
- Understood that the main goal is to create distractors designed to challenge LLMs within given system instructions.  
- Planned to build an application to help generate distractors efficiently.  

**Action Items:**  
- Develop the first version of the distractor creation app.

## Meeting 2 — Application Development and First Drafts  
**Date:** 06-10-2025  
**Agenda:** Building the distractor creation tool and generating initial samples  

**Discussion:**  
- Completed an initial version of the app for making distractors.  
- Each team member created 3–5 distractors for one conversation using the tool.  
- Shared and compared results to ensure the app worked as expected.

## Meeting 3 — Clarification of Task  
**Date:** 13-10-2025  
**Agenda:** Resolve misunderstanding about annotation versus creation  

**Discussion:**  
- Realized the team had been annotating existing distractors instead of creating new ones.  
- Discussed and clarified that the task was to generate original distractors.  
- Updated the project plan to correct the workflow.  

**Action Items:**  
- Start creating original distractors as intended.

## Meeting 4 — Manual Creation and Presentation Preparation  
**Date:** 16-10-2025  
**Agenda:** Move from app-based creation to Google Sheets and prepare progress presentation  

**Discussion:**  
- Decided not to use the application temporarily and to create distractors directly in Google Sheets.  
- Worked on preparing a presentation summarizing progress for supervisors.  
- Agreed to review distractor examples as a team before the presentation.  

**Action Items:**  
- Finalize slides and examples for the presentation.

## Meeting 5 — Coordination with Other Groups  
**Date:** 22-10-2025  
**Agenda:** Align annotation guidelines with other project groups  

**Discussion:**  
- Met with other groups to compare distractor styles and methods.  
- Agreed to follow shared annotation guidelines so that all teams create distractors in a consistent way.  
- Decided to use the same application for future work across all teams.  

**Action Items:**  
- Update internal documentation with the common annotation guidelines.  
- Continue distractor creation following the shared process.
